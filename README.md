## Scala - Springboot - Swagger - RestAPI

### Starting project

- Be sure you have SBT installed in your system (use `sbt --version`), I use version 1.10
- If SBT not installed, I recommend installing it using SDKMAN! (use `sdk version`), script: 5.18.2, native: 0.4.6
- While located in the main folder run `sbt run` to install `build.sbt` dependencies and start the project
- You can check Swagger documentation and interact with the APIS going to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
